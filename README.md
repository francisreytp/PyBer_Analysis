# PyBer_Analysis
    Chart Analysis

## Project Overview
    We are tasked to evaluate the transportation data from different cities.
    We were provided with datas that can provide us information to graphically show our findings
    
## Objectives
    The goals for this challenge are for you to:
    Use Pandas functions like groupby, pivot, resample, and reset_index on a DataFrame.
    Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.
    Create a new DataFrame from multiple groupby() Series.
    Format columns of a DataFrame.
    Create a multiple-line graph.
    Annotate and apply styling to the chart.

## Resources
    Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv Software: Anaconda, 
    Python 3.7.4, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code 1.40.2, Pycharm


## Summary
    With the help of Matplotlib in Python, we can represent the datas throught graphs. By categorizing the city type as Urban, Suburban and Rural we can plot the number of rides per city and its relation to average fare: We were able to show this effectively using scatter dot plot. Anothor chart that we used to summarize the statistics is the box-and-whisker plot.
    Pie chart was used to show a ratio of each city type, in regards to the total rides and another on the total fare.
    Finally we showed the fare volume by each city type from the beginning of the year through the end of April.

## Conclusion
    All throught the time, the urbanized area gets high volume of transport which translates to the higher cost of fare. And it's relatively true for lower cost on the rural cities.
